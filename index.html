                    usually remains consistent from one webpage to another —
                    having inconsistent navigation on your website will just
                    lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers
                    consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather
                    than an individual component, but that's not a requirement;
                    in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is
                    better for
                    <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">accessibility</a>,
                    as screen readers can read the two features better if they

                    A big area in the center that contains most of the unique
                    content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want
                    to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you
                    want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one

                    example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain
                    the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there

                    A strip across the bottom of the page that generally
                    contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info.
                    It's a place to put common information (like the header) but
                    usually, that information is not critical or secondary to
                    the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for

        <h2>HTML layout elements in more detail</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main"
                    ><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></a
                >
                is for content <em>unique to this page.</em> Use
                <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> only <em>once</em> per page, and put
                it directly inside
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body"
                    ><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a
                >. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
                    ><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a
                >
                encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own
                without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"
                    ><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a
                >
                is similar to <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, but it is more for
                grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one
                single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of
                article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's considered
                best practice to begin each section with a
                <a
                    href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals"
                    >heading</a
                >; also note that you can break <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s up
                into different <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s, or
                <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s up into different
                <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s, depending on the context.

                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside"
                    ><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a
                >
                contains content that is not directly related to the main
                content but can provide additional information indirectly
                related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related
                links, etc.).
            </li>

                >
                represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body"
                    ><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a
                >
                it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child
                of an
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
                    ><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a
                >
                or
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"
                    ><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a
                >
                it defines a specific header for that section (try not to
                confuse this with
                <a
                    href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#adding_a_title"
                    >titles and headings</a

                >
                contains the main navigation functionality for the page.
                Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
            </li>

                >
                represents a group of end content for a page.

            There once was a man named O'Dell<br />
            Who loved to write HTML<br />
            But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br />
            and his markup didn't read very well.

            Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared,
            but determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and
            prepared to do battle, hoping that his distress call had made it
            through.

            Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty
            statement and pondering when the next spin off series would come
            out, when an enchanted distress letter flew through his window and
            landed in his lap. He read it hazily and sighed; "better get back to
            work then", he mused.
