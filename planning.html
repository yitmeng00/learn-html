                    Once you've planned out the structure of a simple webpage,
                    the next logical step is to try to work out what content you
                    want to put on a whole website, what pages you need, and how
                    they should be arranged and link to one another for the best
                    possible user experience. This is called
                    <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Information_architecture"
                        >Information architecture</a
                    >. In a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go
                    into this process, but for a simple website of a few pages,
                    this can be fairly simple, and fun!

                    <li>
                        Bear in mind that you'll have a few elements common to
                        most (if not all) pages — such as the navigation menu,
                        and the footer content. If your site is for a business,
                        for example, it's a good idea to have your contact
                        information available in the footer on each page. Note
                        down what you want to have common to every page.

                            alt="the common features of the travel site to go on every page: title and logo, contact, copyright, terms and conditions, language chooser, accessibility policy"

                            height="438"

                        />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, draw a rough sketch of what you might want the
                        structure of each page to look like (it might look like
                        our simple website above). Note what each block is going
                        to be.

                            src="assets/site-structure.png"
                            alt="A simple diagram of a sample site structure, with a header, main content area, two optional sidebars, and footer"

                            height="271"
                            loading="lazy"
                        />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now, brainstorm all the other (not common to every page)
                        content you want to have on your website — write a big
                        list down.
                        <img
                            src="assets/feature-list.png"
                            alt="A long list of all the features that we could put on our travel site, from searching, to special offers and country-specific info"
                            width="700"
                            height="1244"
                            loading="lazy"
                        />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, try to sort all these content items into groups,
                        to give you an idea of what parts might live together on
                        different pages. This is very similar to a technique
                        called
                        <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Card_sorting"
                            >Card sorting</a
                        >.
                        <img
                            src="assets/card-sorting.png"
                            alt="The items that should appear on a holiday site sorted into 5 categories: Search, Specials, Country-specific info, Search results, and Buy things"
                            width="700"
                            height="675"
                            loading="lazy"
                        />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now try to sketch a rough sitemap — have a bubble for
                        each page on your site, and draw lines to show the
                        typical workflow between pages. The homepage will
                        probably be in the center, and link to most if not all
                        of the others; most of the pages in a small site should
                        be available from the main navigation, although there
                        are exceptions. You might also want to include notes
                        about how things might be presented.
